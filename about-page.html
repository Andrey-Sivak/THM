    The brand awareness objective is for advertisers who want to show ads to people who are more likely to recall them.
    <br><br>
    The brand awareness objective gives you the estimated ad recall lift (people) metric, which shows how many people we estimate would remember your ad if we asked them within two days.
    <br><br>
    A brand lift study is required for the most accurate measurement of ad recall. However, if your campaign doesn't meet the criteria to conduct a full study, the estimated ad recall lift (people) metric can be an accessible alternative.
